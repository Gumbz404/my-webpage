    <h1>WELCOME TO  MY WEBPAGE!!</h1>
    <h4>As a Moringa School student,I have just finished my first week of studies and I will talk more about myself here</h4>

    <p> Hello there! My name is Samuel Mutwiri Gumbo,currently studying at Moringa School where I mannaged to learn two coding languages on my first week of school.Namely:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
  </ul>
  <p> In my first week of school, I managed to undergo some of the school programmes such as pair programming whereby I went through the curriculum content and manage to create some projects individually for practise and together with my partner as well. This was made easier after learning the basics of programming and mostly how to use the command prompt found in Terminal.
  HTML,that is Hyper Text Markup Language is one of the coding languages that has enabled me to create this webpage something that I find quite fascinating even up to date.CSS on the other hand (Cascadng Style Sheets) enable e to make my webpage seem more stylish and "fancy" rather than making a simple one that would look abit plain and boring!</p>
  <p> Learning programming has been a fun ride this far and through the course structure, I managed to do a project on creating my first website, Hello World, which showed me the basics of how to create a website by using terminal whererby we made files and folders using different computer commands such as mkdir..and touch.Atom enabled us to write the code for this website using HTML language.After following these steps making my first website was simplifiedHave a look at the project <a href="https://github.com/Gumbz404/day-1.git"> here</a>. The project was mainly about creating your first website as a programmer, though this project mainly shows one which coding language to use when creating a website and in this case, the language used is HTML </p>
  <p> The second project I managed to do was tiled my webpage. This was the project whereby I now used CSS to style up my webpage.CSS uses various tags such as h1,h2,p,ul,li which help in modifying the text or whatever is displayed on the webpage but modifying the text used, colour,font weight etc.Have a look at the webpage<a href="https://github.com/Gumbz404/my-first-website.git"> here</a></p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>As you can see from the smile, one of my hobbies is taking pictures, random ones like the one here where I took in a garden. On top of this I also enjoy music and personally I make hip-hop music. My passion for music started back in high school (Maranda High School) where I would occassionally perform at school events. This lead to me taking it beyond being just a hobbie and it is now something I would like to do in the future.Personally I have o working experience since I Hve never worked anywhere before though I am willing to take any opportunities presented to me once I'm done with the course.</p>
  <p>Now, let's talk about <span class="bold">programming</span> .Back in high school, I wanted to study game design and development much to the dissapointment of my father. Nevertheless, I had to follow my passion and therefore my sister informed me about Moringa School where I could learn more about programming as I await to start studying game design and development once I am done studying here at Moringa since I will have the basic information on coding and this will smoothen my learning the following year.</p>
